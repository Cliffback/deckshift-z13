# DeckShift

**Version 0.2.2-z13.2** — Steam Deck-style gaming mode for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.com). Press the side button (Armory Crate / `XF86Launch3`) to toggle Gaming Mode (Steam Big Picture in Gamescope), or drive the whole thing from the control panel in your bar (`Super+Alt+G`).

Lineage: forked from Super-Shift-S-Omarchy-Deck-Mode, briefly renamed Omarchy Deck, then renamed DeckShift.

> **This is the Z13 fork** ([Cliffback/deckshift-z13](https://github.com/Cliffback/deckshift-z13)), tracking [28allday/deckshift](https://github.com/28allday/deckshift) `master` on the `z13` branch. It carries ASUS ROG Flow Z13 (2025) fixes on top of upstream:
>
> - **Side-button toggle** — `XF86Launch3` (Armory Crate) enters/exits Gaming Mode. `Super+Shift+S` is left to Fn+F6 (firmware screenshot key), and the evdev monitor watches `KEY_PROG3` only instead of `Super+Shift+R`.
> - **Display seeds** — `OUTPUT_CONNECTOR=*,eDP-1` (prefer external when docked) and `STEAM_DISPLAY_REFRESH_LIMITS=60,180` (180 Hz panel), written only when absent so the control panel keeps ownership.
> - **Gaming-session sentinel** — written in `switch-to-gaming` before the SDDM restart, closing the window before the wrapper starts.
> - **Quattro NetworkManager cleanup** — removes stale `10-iwd-backend.conf` / `20-unmanaged-systemd.conf` when their backends are inactive; `gamescope-nm-stop` no longer stops NM or restarts iwd.
> - **Consolidated pacman hook** — re-applies cap_sys_nice, the session entry, competing-session disables, `os-session-select`, and the Heroic patch after upgrades.
> - **Power profiles via Omarchy** — applied through `omarchy-powerprofiles-set autodetect <profile>` so the per-AC/battery state file stays in sync and `omarchy-powerprofiles-init` no longer clobbers the restore.
> - **Migration-safe session cleanup** — the old session-file cleanup no longer deletes package-owned `/usr/bin/steamos-*` / `jupiter-biosupdate`, and the client package is reinstalled in place (never removed first) with `--aur` forced. Fixes a migration that removed `gamescope-session-steam-git`, resolved the reinstall to the conflicting CachyOS repo provider, and left Gaming Mode launching gamescope with no Steam client.
> - **Retired-stack cleanup** — install and uninstall remove the old `gaming-mode.hook`, `gaming-mode-post-update`, `gaming-session-switch.pre-hotfix`, and the stale `~/.config/hypr/gaming-mode.conf` keybind, so the old pacman hook can no longer revert DeckShift's `os-session-select` after an upgrade.
> - **`--verify` is sudo-aware** — probes `sudo -n` once and reports root-owned files as `SKIPPED` instead of a false 26-file `MISSING` list when credentials are not cached; also checks `sessions.d/steam` so a missing session client is caught.
>
> Sync from upstream: `git fetch upstream && git checkout master && git merge --ff-only upstream/master && git checkout z13 && git rebase master`.

> **Target:** [Omarchy](https://omarchy.com) — Arch + Hyprland + SDDM. DeckShift depends on Omarchy-specific helpers (`omarchy-pkg-add`, `omarchy-install-gaming-steam`, etc.) and is not intended to be cross-distro. Omarchy 4 (Quickshell / Lua config) is the primary target; pre-4 installs are still handled via the legacy `.conf` fallbacks.

## What's New

### v0.2.2-z13.2 — Stop writing the dead pre-Quattro hyprland.conf

`setup_fcitx_silence` appended `env = FCITX_NO_WAYLAND_DIAGNOSE,1` to `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`. Omarchy 4's Lua config provider does not read that file, so the line did nothing while looking effective. The env is already set through `~/.config/environment.d/90-fcitx-wayland.conf` (imported into the session by uwsm, so it reaches Hyprland and every child process), which is now the only mechanism. The legacy `.conf` write is gone; the Lua-first/`.conf`-fallback pattern used for keybinds and autostart is unchanged.

### v0.2.2-z13.1 — Migration no longer strands Gaming Mode without a Steam client

Migrating an existing Z13 install could delete `gamescope-session-steam-git` and never put it back. The cleanup step removed `/usr/bin/steamos-*` and `/usr/bin/jupiter-biosupdate` as "old custom session files", but those are owned by that package — so the package looked corrupt, the installer queued it for remove-and-reinstall, and the reinstall resolved the bare name to the CachyOS repo's `gamescope-session-cachyos` (which `Provides`/`Conflicts` the same names). That transaction aborted on the conflict with the installed `gamescope-session-git`, leaving no `sessions.d/steam`. `gamescope-session-plus` only sets `CLIENTCMD` from that file, so Gaming Mode would start gamescope and then launch nothing.

Three changes close it: the cleanup now skips any file owned by a pacman package (`pacman -Qo`), the client package is **reinstalled in place** rather than removed first, and the install forces `--aur` so the name can never resolve to the repo provider. `--verify` now checks `sessions.d/steam` directly, not just the package name, and prints the exact recovery command.

The installer also cleans up the retired Z13 stack it superseded: the old `/etc/pacman.d/hooks/gaming-mode.hook` (which targeted the same packages and could revert DeckShift's `os-session-select` on every upgrade), `gaming-mode-post-update`, `gaming-session-switch.pre-hotfix`, and the stale `~/.config/hypr/gaming-mode.conf` keybind. `uninstall.sh` removes them too.

### v0.2.2 — Screen sharing fixed for real, session logs, an uninstaller

Screen sharing in Chromium/Firefox broke after every Gaming Mode round-trip, and the recovery helper that was supposed to prevent it turned out to have never once run — `switch-to-desktop` wrote its trigger marker two lines after the command that kills the script's own session. The marker now lands before the teardown, and the helper itself was rewritten to fix what actually breaks (Steam activates a portal frontend inside gamescope with an empty environment, and it squats there when the desktop returns): it restarts that frontend so the Hyprland backend comes back on its own, and no longer bounces pipewire — which was disconnecting all your audio for nothing. It also detects the broken state directly, so it can never again be silently disabled by a lost marker. On top of that, exiting Gaming Mode no longer overwrites your CPU governor and power profile with a `powersave`/`balanced` guess. (Thanks to a heroic bit of diagnosis by Filip Špaldoň.)

There's now a proper `./uninstall.sh` (also by Filip) with a `--dry-run` mode, replacing the README's drifted manual command list.

Gaming Mode tears down Hyprland, so session output used to vanish with the desktop. The panel now has a **Capture session** toggle: when it's on, `switch-to-gaming` and the gamescope wrapper write a dated log under `~/.local/state/omarchy/nosignal.deckshift/` (the 10 newest are kept). **View** opens the default terminal on the latest file and `cat`s it. Uninstall removes that folder too.

If Omarchy had already enabled NVIDIA DRM modeset, the installer still warned it was missing and failed to notice Limine — then asked you to edit a bootloader config you did not need to touch. It now recognises that setup, and only offers to enable modeset the Omarchy way if it really is off. `--verify` no longer reports you missing the `video` / `input` / `wheel` groups just because you have not logged out yet; it will still remind you that a new login is what actually applies them.

### v0.2.1 — Fresh installs no longer fail on removed multilib packages

Arch removed `lib32-openal`, `lib32-sdl2-compat` and `lib32-libvdpau` from the multilib repo (the Steam runtime bundles its own copies, so Steam no longer depends on them). Fresh installs hit `error: target not found` on those three and died with `FATAL: Failed to install Steam dependencies`. They're gone from the dependency list, and the installer now skips any required package the repos no longer offer instead of aborting.

### v0.2.0 — Native Omarchy 4 control panel (replaces the settings TUI)

The gum-based `deckshift-settings` TUI is gone, replaced by **`nosignal.deckshift`**, a native omarchy-shell (Quickshell) plugin: a bar icon plus a panel that both configures Gaming Mode and launches it.

- **Everything the TUI did, in the panel** — monitor, resolution, refresh rate, GPU mode and hide-monitor, each a themed dropdown that only offers modes the selected monitor actually reports. Edits stay **buffered** until you press **Save**, and the same over-spec warnings the TUI raised are shown inline.
- **Launch Gaming Mode from the panel.** A confirm step guards it — entering Gaming Mode restarts SDDM and closes your desktop session, so it should never be one stray click away. If you have unsaved changes the confirm says so explicitly, because Gaming Mode would start with the *last saved* values, not what's on screen. `Super+Shift+S` still works exactly as before.
- **Live capability data.** Picking a monitor re-derives the resolution and refresh lists from that monitor's mode list on the spot. A connector saved earlier but not currently plugged in is labelled `not connected` rather than silently offering nothing.
- **Fixed: saved settings never reached the running session.** Both the TUI and the panel write `~/.config/environment.d/gamescope-session-plus.conf`, then nudge systemd so the change applies without a re-login. The TUI called `systemctl --user import-environment KEY`, which copies a variable *from the calling process's environment* — i.e. the value read at login, the one just replaced. It propagated nothing. The panel calls `set-environment KEY=VALUE` instead, which actually pushes the new value.
- Keys not managed by DeckShift (`ADAPTIVE_SYNC`, `HDR_ENABLED`, anything hand-added) are preserved across saves, as before.
- Re-running `./deckshift.sh` installs the plugin, wires it into `shell.json` (both `plugins[]` and the bar), adds a `Super+Alt+G` toggle keybind, and removes the old TUI and its app-menu entry. Already-running shells need `omarchy-restart-shell` to pick the panel up.
- `--verify` gained a control-panel section: plugin files present, registered in `plugins[]` (a plugin on disk but missing there loads its bar icon and then no-ops on every summon), bar icon, and keybind.

**Requires Omarchy 4** for the panel — the installer skips it with a warning on older builds, where Gaming Mode itself still works via the keybinds.

Older releases are summarised in the [Changelog](#changelog).

## Control panel

After install, open the panel from the **game-controller icon in your bar**, press `Super+Alt+G`, or run `omarchy-shell shell toggle nosignal.deckshift`. It changes Gaming Mode display settings without editing config files:

| Option | What it sets in `gamescope-session-plus.conf` |
|---|---|
| Monitor      | `OUTPUT_CONNECTOR` (auto-detected from connected DRM outputs; pick or clear) |
| Resolution   | `SCREEN_WIDTH` / `SCREEN_HEIGHT` (offers monitor's native modes + common presets) |
| Refresh rate | `CUSTOM_REFRESH_RATES` (parsed from EDID, plus common rates as fallback) |
| GPU — direct           | `VULKAN_ADAPTER` + `GBM_BACKEND` (NVIDIA) or `DRI_PRIME` (AMD/Intel) — single-GPU desktops |
| GPU — `[hybrid-nvidia]` | `__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1`, `__VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only`, `__GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia` — hybrid laptops with NVIDIA dGPU + iGPU-attached eDP |
| GPU — `[hybrid-amd]`    | `DRI_PRIME=pci-…` + `MESA_VK_DEVICE_SELECT=<vendor:device>` + `MESA_VK_DEVICE_SELECT_FORCE_DEFAULT_DEVICE=1` — hybrid laptops with AMD dGPU + iGPU |
| (clear)                | Removes all GPU keys; gamescope auto-picks at runtime |

The `[hybrid-*]` options only appear when the relevant GPU pair is detected.

Each dropdown lists what the selected monitor actually reports as `supported`, followed by common presets — a preset the monitor can't do is labelled as such rather than hidden, since EDID data is occasionally wrong and forcing a mode is sometimes the right call.

Selections are **buffered**: nothing is written to disk until you press **Save**, and the header shows `unsaved changes` until you do. Saved values apply to the next Gaming Mode launch — no re-login needed.

**Launch Gaming Mode** does the same thing as `Super+Shift+S`, behind a confirm step (it closes your desktop session). With unsaved changes pending, the confirm warns that Gaming Mode will use the last *saved* settings.

Keyboard: `Esc` close · `r` refresh · `s` save · `g` launch · `Tab` and arrows move between controls.

> **Requires Omarchy 4.** The panel is an omarchy-shell (Quickshell) plugin. On pre-4 installs the installer skips it and Gaming Mode is driven by the keybinds alone.

## What It Does

This installer transforms your desktop into a dual-mode system:

- **Desktop Mode** — your normal Hyprland session.
- **Gaming Mode** — full-screen Steam Big Picture running inside Gamescope (the same compositor used by the Steam Deck), with automatic performance tuning, controller support, and external drive mounting.

Switching between modes is seamless — SDDM handles session transitions, and your network, audio, and peripherals carry over automatically.

## Requirements

- **OS**: [Omarchy](https://omarchy.com) (Arch Linux + Hyprland + SDDM)
- **GPU**: AMD (discrete or APU), NVIDIA (discrete), or Intel (Arc / Iris Xe), or any hybrid combo of the above
  - Intel Arc (Alchemist, Battlemage): well-supported
  - Tiger Lake / Alder Lake Iris Xe: playable for indies / older AAA
  - Older Gen8/9 Intel (Skylake, Kaby Lake): expect slow/glitchy — installer warns and asks before continuing
  - Hybrid laptops (NVIDIA + iGPU, AMD dGPU + iGPU): use the corresponding `[hybrid-*]` GPU mode in the control panel
- **AUR Helper**: yay or paru (for ChimeraOS session packages)

> **Note**: This script targets Omarchy and its stack (Hyprland, SDDM, iwd, UWSM, PipeWire). It works on other Arch + Hyprland setups with light tweaks, but isn't tested there.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/28allday/deckshift.git
cd deckshift
chmod +x deckshift.sh
./deckshift.sh
```

The installer is fully interactive and walks you through each step.

After install, open the control panel (bar icon or `Super+Alt+G`) and pick:

- A monitor
- A resolution / refresh rate
- A GPU mode — for hybrid laptops, prefer `[hybrid-nvidia]` or `[hybrid-amd]` over the direct options

Press **Save**, then **Launch Gaming Mode** (or `Super+Shift+S`). Turn on **Capture session** in the panel first if you want a log of that run (kept under `~/.local/state/omarchy/nosignal.deckshift/`, 10 newest).

> Already-running shells won't show the panel until you run `omarchy-restart-shell` once.

## Usage

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Enter Gaming Mode | `Super + Shift + S` |
| Return to Desktop | `Super + Shift + R` *(global keybind monitor catches it inside Gamescope)* |
| Return to Desktop (alternative) | Steam → Power → **Switch to Desktop** |
| Open control panel | Bar icon, `Super + Alt + G`, or `omarchy-shell shell toggle nosignal.deckshift` |
| Launch Gaming Mode from panel | **Launch Gaming Mode** button (confirms first) |
| Capture a session log | Panel **Capture session** toggle, then launch. Logs land in `~/.local/state/omarchy/nosignal.deckshift/` (10 newest kept) |
| Open session logs | **View** in the panel (terminal `cat` of the newest session log) |

### Command-Line Options

```
./deckshift.sh              # Full installation
./deckshift.sh --verify     # Verify installation only
./deckshift.sh --version    # Show version
./deckshift.sh --help       # Show help
```

## Recovery from a Black Screen

If Gaming Mode (or anything else) leaves you on a black screen, here's the order of escalation:

1. **`Super + Shift + R`** — the keybind monitor inside Gamescope still works on a black screen as long as the kernel is processing input.
2. **Wait 10 seconds.** Sometimes the display is just renegotiating EDID after a session swap; give it a beat.
3. **Switch to a TTY**: press `Ctrl + Alt + F2` (try `F3` / `F4` if F2 is blank). You'll get a text login prompt.
4. Log in as your user, then run one of:
   - **Cleanest** — log the graphical session out cleanly and bounce back to SDDM:
     ```
     loginctl terminate-user $USER
     ```
   - **Heavier** — restart the whole display manager:
     ```
     sudo systemctl restart sddm
     ```
5. **From SSH** (from another machine on the network) the same commands work — handy if the box is wedged but its network is alive.
6. **Last resort:** hold the power button. Safe in this situation; you didn't cause the freeze, gamescope did.

If you keep ending up on a black screen, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) — most often it's a GPU↔connector mismatch on hybrid laptops (e.g. NVIDIA mode targeting `eDP-1`, which on a hybrid is wired to the iGPU). Switch the GPU mode in the control panel to `[hybrid-nvidia]` and pick `eDP-1` for the monitor.

## What Gets Installed

### Packages

The installer checks for and offers to install:

**Core Steam Dependencies**
- `steam`, `gamescope`, `mangohud`, `gamemode`
- Vulkan loaders and Mesa libraries (32-bit and 64-bit)
- Audio libraries (`lib32-alsa-plugins`, `lib32-libpulse`)
- Networking (`networkmanager`, `lib32-libnm`)
- Fonts (`ttf-liberation`)

**GPU-Specific Drivers**
- **NVIDIA (Turing+ / GSP firmware — GTX 16xx, RTX 20–50xx, etc.)**: `nvidia-utils`, `lib32-nvidia-utils`, `nvidia-settings`, `libva-nvidia-driver`
- **NVIDIA (legacy Maxwell/Pascal/Volta — GTX 9xx/10xx, Quadro P/M)**: `nvidia-580xx-utils`, `lib32-nvidia-580xx-utils`, `nvidia-settings`, `libva-nvidia-driver`
- **AMD**: `vulkan-radeon`, `lib32-vulkan-radeon`, `libvdpau`
- **Intel**: `vulkan-intel`, `lib32-vulkan-intel`, `intel-media-driver`

The correct NVIDIA driver branch is auto-selected via Omarchy's `omarchy-hw-nvidia-gsp` / `omarchy-hw-nvidia-without-gsp` helpers — no manual override needed. Intel-only systems get a generation warning + Y/N prompt before continuing (Skylake/Kaby Lake era is slow; Tiger Lake / Arc is fine).

**AUR Packages** (via yay/paru)
- `gamescope-session-git` — ChimeraOS base session framework
- `gamescope-session-steam-git` — ChimeraOS Steam session with compatibility scripts
- `proton-ge-custom-bin` (optional)

> On CachyOS-enabled systems the `cachyos` repo also ships `gamescope-session-cachyos`, which `Provides`/`Conflicts` both of the above. Always install with `--aur` (`yay -S --aur gamescope-session-steam-git`) so the helper pins the AUR package instead of resolving the bare name to the repo provider and aborting on the conflict.

**Other Requirements**
- `python-evdev` — for the keyboard shortcut monitor
- `jq` — for the control panel's hardware/config reads
- `ntfs-3g` — for mounting NTFS game drives
- `udisks2` — for external drive auto-mounting
- `xcb-util-cursor`, `libcap`, `curl`, `pciutils`

**Optional: Xbox Bluetooth Controllers**
- `xpadneo-dkms`, `linux-headers` — wireless Xbox pad button mapping & rumble for Big Picture / RetroArch (wired pads work without this)
- Prompted opt-in during install; pair with `Super+Ctrl+B`

Package installs use Omarchy's `omarchy-pkg-add` (idempotent, double-checks pacman actually installed each package).

## How It Works

### Session Switching Flow

```
Desktop Mode (Hyprland)
    │
    ├─ Super+Shift+S pressed
    │   └─ switch-to-gaming runs:
    │       ├─ Masks suspend targets (prevents sleep during switch)
    │       ├─ Updates SDDM config to gaming session
    │       └─ Restarts SDDM → boots into Gaming Mode
    │
Gaming Mode (Gamescope + Steam Big Picture)
    │
    ├─ On session start (gamescope-session-nm-wrapper):
    │   ├─ Saves current CPU governor + power profile to ~/.cache/deckshift/saved-state
    │   ├─ Enables performance mode (CPU governor → performance, GPU max power, PPD → performance)
    │   ├─ Starts NetworkManager (for Steam network access)
    │   ├─ Launches steam-library-mount (external drive detection)
    │   ├─ Starts gaming-keybind-monitor (Super+Shift+R listener)
    │   └─ Launches gamescope-session-plus with Steam
    │
    ├─ Super+Shift+R pressed (or Steam → Power → Switch to Desktop)
    │   └─ switch-to-desktop runs:
    │       ├─ Reads ~/.cache/deckshift/saved-state and restores CPU governor + PPD synchronously
    │       ├─ Unmasks suspend targets
    │       ├─ Restores Bluetooth
    │       ├─ Shuts down Steam gracefully
    │       ├─ Kills gamescope
    │       ├─ Updates SDDM config to Hyprland session
    │       └─ Atomic systemctl restart sddm → boots into Desktop Mode
    │
    └─ On session cleanup (trap handler — backup path):
        ├─ Kills steam-library-mount and keybind-monitor
        ├─ Stops NetworkManager, restores iwd WiFi
        └─ Re-applies saved CPU governor + power profile (idempotent if switch-to-desktop already ran)
```

### Performance Mode

When Gaming Mode starts, the session wrapper saves your current CPU governor and power-profiles-daemon profile to `~/.cache/deckshift/saved-state`, then:

- Sets CPU governor to `performance` on all cores
- **NVIDIA**: enables persistence mode, sets power limit to maximum, disables runtime suspend
- **AMD**: sets GPU to high performance via `power_dpm_force_performance_level`
- Sets the power profile to `performance` (when `power-profiles-daemon` is available)

On exit, both `switch-to-desktop` (synchronous, runs first) and the wrapper's trap (backup) read the saved file and restore the **exact** values that were set before Gaming Mode.

> **Caveat — Omarchy + AC**: Omarchy's `omarchy-powerprofiles-init` autostarts on every Hyprland session and sets the power profile to `performance` whenever the laptop is on AC. So even after a perfect deckshift restore, the next Hyprland session will reset to `performance` if you're plugged in. This is Omarchy's intended behaviour, not a deckshift bug — it'd happen to any program that tries to set `balanced` and then a Hyprland session restarts. To opt out, comment `exec-once = omarchy-powerprofiles-init` in `~/.config/hypr/autostart.conf`. On battery the deckshift restore lands at the saved value and stays there.

### GPU Detection

The installer detects:

- **AMD dGPU**: PCI device names (Navi, RDNA, Vega discrete cards)
- **AMD APU**: integrated GPU codenames (Phoenix, Rembrandt, Van Gogh, etc.)
- **NVIDIA**: lspci, enables DRM modeset the Omarchy way (`/etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf` + mkinitcpio modules) if missing, picks `nvidia-utils` vs `nvidia-580xx-utils` via Omarchy's GSP-firmware detection
- **Intel (Arc / Iris Xe / iGPU)**: `i915` / `xe` kernel drivers
- **Hybrid combinations**: detected by the control panel, which surfaces the appropriate `[hybrid-*]` GPU mode

The installer itself no longer picks a monitor / resolution / refresh / GPU — those are user choices, made via the control panel after install.

### NetworkManager Integration

Many systems running Hyprland use `iwd` or `systemd-networkd` instead of NetworkManager. Since Steam requires NetworkManager for its network settings UI, the installer creates a managed handoff:

1. On Gaming Mode entry: NetworkManager starts, takes over networking.
2. On Gaming Mode exit: NetworkManager stops, iwd/networkd resumes.

This avoids conflicts and ensures both desktop and gaming sessions have network access.

### External Drive Auto-Mount

The `steam-library-mount` daemon runs during Gaming Mode and:

1. Scans all connected drives for Steam library folders.
2. Mounts drives containing `steamapps/` directories via udisks2.
3. Monitors udev for hot-plugged drives.
4. Unmounts non-Steam drives to avoid clutter.

Supports ext4, NTFS, btrfs, xfs, exfat, f2fs, and vfat filesystems.

## Configuration

### Config File

The installer reads from `/etc/gaming-mode.conf` (or `~/.gaming-mode.conf` if it exists):

```bash
PERFORMANCE_MODE=enabled   # Set to "disabled" to skip performance tuning

### Gamescope Session Config

The installer **only** writes GPU + static keys to `~/.config/environment.d/gamescope-session-plus.conf`:

```bash
# Static — every install:
STEAM_ALLOW_DRIVE_UNMOUNT=1
FCITX_NO_WAYLAND_DIAGNOSE=1
SDL_VIDEO_MINIMIZE_ON_FOCUS_LOSS=0

# GPU-specific (NVIDIA shown):
VULKAN_ADAPTER=10de:25ac
GBM_BACKEND=nvidia-drm
```

Display keys (`SCREEN_WIDTH`, `SCREEN_HEIGHT`, `CUSTOM_REFRESH_RATES`, `OUTPUT_CONNECTOR`) and hybrid-PRIME env vars are **owned exclusively by the control panel**. Re-running the installer preserves your choices.

**NVIDIA note**: Gamescope on NVIDIA is currently capped at 2560×1440. The control panel labels any higher resolution as unsupported.

### Shader Cache

The installer configures a 12 GB shader cache by default in `/etc/environment.d/99-shader-cache.conf`:

```bash
MESA_SHADER_CACHE_MAX_SIZE=12G
__GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_SIZE=12884901888
DXVK_STATE_CACHE=1
```

## NVIDIA-Specific Notes

- **DRM modeset**: required so Gamescope can take over the display. The installer treats it as already on if `/sys/module/nvidia_drm/parameters/modeset` is `Y`, Omarchy's `/etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf` has `options nvidia_drm modeset=1`, or the kernel cmdline has `nvidia-drm.modeset=1` (any bootloader). If missing, it writes the same two files and rebuilds the initramfs (`limine-mkinitcpio` on Limine/UKI, `mkinitcpio -P` otherwise).
- **Resolution cap**: Gamescope on NVIDIA is limited to 2560×1440 maximum.
- **Force composition**: the NVIDIA wrapper automatically adds `--force-composition` if your Gamescope version supports it.
- **Environment**: `GBM_BACKEND=nvidia-drm` and related vars are set automatically.
- **Persistence mode**: enabled during gaming, disabled on exit.

### Hybrid laptop note

On a hybrid laptop (NVIDIA dGPU + AMD/Intel iGPU), the laptop screen (`eDP-1`) is wired to the iGPU. NVIDIA cannot scan out directly to it — pointing the direct `[nvidia]` mode at `eDP-1` will black-screen.

Use **`[hybrid-nvidia]`** in the control panel instead. Gamescope will run on the iGPU (which owns `eDP-1`) and games inside will render on NVIDIA via PRIME render offload, with the rendered frames flowing back through DMA-BUF for scanout. This is the same architecture Steam Deck uses (just with one GPU).

## Bootloader Support

The installer enables NVIDIA DRM modeset via:

- `/etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf` — `options nvidia_drm modeset=1`
- `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf.d/nvidia.conf` — `MODULES+=(nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm)`

That works with Limine (Omarchy default), GRUB, or systemd-boot. The installer still detects which bootloader you use so it can rebuild the initramfs correctly.

## Troubleshooting

### Verify Installation

Run the built-in verification to check all files, permissions, packages, and services:

```bash
./deckshift.sh --verify
```

### Common Issues

**Gaming Mode shows a black screen on `eDP-1`**

Most likely a hybrid-laptop GPU↔connector mismatch — NVIDIA can't drive the iGPU's display.

- Switch the GPU mode to **`[hybrid-nvidia]`** (or `[hybrid-amd]` for AMD-only hybrids) in the control panel.
- If you only have the laptop screen, that's the only working path — direct NVIDIA mode requires an external display plugged into the dGPU's HDMI/DP output.

See [Recovery from a Black Screen](#recovery-from-a-black-screen) for how to get out of the black-screen state.

**Gaming Mode doesn't start**

- Check NVIDIA DRM modeset: `cat /sys/module/nvidia_drm/parameters/modeset` (expect `Y`) or `cat /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf`
- Verify gamescope works: `gamescope -- steam`
- Check session logs: `journalctl --user -u gamescope-session -n 50`

**No network in Gaming Mode**

- Test NM manually: `sudo systemctl start NetworkManager && nmcli general`
- Check polkit rules: `ls -la /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-gamescope-*`
- Check logs: `journalctl -t gamescope-nm -n 20`

**Super+Shift+R doesn't work in Gaming Mode**

- Ensure `python-evdev` is installed: `pacman -Qi python-evdev`
- Ensure user is in `input` group: `groups | grep input`
- Check the keybind monitor: `journalctl -t gaming-keybind-monitor -n 20`
- Fallback: Steam → Power → **Switch to Desktop**

**External drives not mounting**

- Ensure `udisks2` is installed: `pacman -Qi udisks2`
- Check polkit rules exist: `ls /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-udisks-gaming.rules`
- Check mount logs: `journalctl -t steam-library-mount -n 20`

**Audio stuttering in Gaming Mode**

- Check PipeWire config exists: `cat /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/10-gaming-latency.conf`
- Try lower quantum: edit the config and set `default.clock.min-quantum = 128`

**Screen sharing in Chromium / Firefox is broken after returning from Gaming Mode (only "Share a tab" works)**

Root cause: while the gamescope session is running, Steam D-Bus-activates `xdg-desktop-portal` inside it. That instance comes up with almost no environment — no `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` — so it can't match a backend and falls back to GTK. It's still running when your Hyprland session returns, so nothing restarts it, it never learns it's on Hyprland, and it never activates `xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland`. With no screencast backend, the source picker is never spawned and the share dialog just sits there. Tab capture works because Chromium does it internally, without the portal.

To confirm: `systemctl --user is-active xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland.service` returns `inactive`.

DeckShift handles this automatically via `/usr/local/bin/deckshift-portal-recovery`, autostarted from `~/.config/hypr/autostart.lua` (Omarchy 4) or `autostart.conf` (pre-4). **If you installed before v0.2.2, re-run `./deckshift.sh`** — earlier versions wrote the trigger marker too late in `switch-to-desktop` to ever survive, so the helper no-oped on every return. If you're on a pre-v0.1.15 install and on Omarchy 4, re-running also fixes the `autostart.conf` wiring, which Omarchy 4's Lua config provider ignores.

To fix a session that's already broken, without a re-login:

```bash
systemctl --user restart xdg-desktop-portal.service
```

then re-open the browser tab. Running `/usr/local/bin/deckshift-portal-recovery` by hand does the same thing plus the GTK backend — since v0.2.2 it detects the bad state on its own, so it no longer needs the marker file to be touched first.

**Suspend fails with "Access denied" after returning from Gaming Mode**

The runtime mask on `suspend.target` from the gaming switch wasn't cleared. DeckShift now handles this in `switch-to-desktop`. For older installs, the one-time fix is:

```bash
sudo systemctl unmask --runtime sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

**Power profile stays on `performance` after Gaming Mode exit**

If you're on AC and using Omarchy, this is expected — see the *Performance Mode* caveat above. The deckshift restore is correctly running; Omarchy's session-init policy is overriding it on the next Hyprland start.

**Intel-only system, Gaming Mode is laggy**

- Older Gen8/9 Intel iGPUs (Skylake, Kaby Lake) struggle with Vulkan workloads. Lower the launch resolution in the control panel — 720p / 1080p makes a big difference.
- If you have a discrete GPU that should take over, check its driver is loaded: `lspci -k | grep -A2 VGA`

**Gaming Mode launches at 60 Hz even though I picked a higher rate**

`--custom-refresh-rates` is gamescope's list of *switchable* rates, not a launch-rate selector. On embedded/DRM output (especially NVIDIA + HDMI) gamescope picks the connector's EDID-preferred mode at first launch, which is usually 60 Hz even when higher modes are enumerated. Two-step fix:

1. Confirm the env var actually reached the session:
   ```bash
   systemctl --user show-environment | grep REFRESH
   journalctl --user -u "gamescope-session-plus@*" -b --no-pager | grep -m1 -- '--custom-refresh-rates'
   ```
   In v0.2.0+ this works without re-login — the control panel pushes saved values into the running session (`systemctl --user set-environment`). On older releases, log out and back in once after saving.
2. Once Steam Big Picture is up, set the rate explicitly: Settings → Display → Refresh Rate → your rate. Steam persists this client-side, so every subsequent Gaming Mode launch will go straight to that rate.

### Log Locations

| Component | Command |
|---|---|
| Session files (opt-in from the panel) | `~/.local/state/omarchy/nosignal.deckshift/session-*.log` (10 newest) |
| Gaming session | `journalctl --user -u gamescope-session` |
| NetworkManager | `journalctl -t gamescope-nm` |
| Drive mounting | `journalctl -t steam-library-mount` |
| Keybind monitor | `journalctl -t gaming-keybind-monitor` |
| Session wrapper | `journalctl -t gamescope-wrapper` |
| Installation | `journalctl -t gaming-mode` |

## Uninstalling

Run the uninstaller from the cloned repo:

```bash
./uninstall.sh --dry-run   # see exactly what it would touch
./uninstall.sh             # remove DeckShift
```

It removes every file DeckShift creates, strips its Hyprland keybinds and
autostart lines (Lua and legacy `.conf`), unwires the control-panel plugin from
`shell.json`, drops `cap_sys_nice` from the gamescope binary, offers to restore
the patched `gamescope-session-plus`, and puts SDDM back on your desktop session
before deleting its config. Every file it edits is backed up alongside the
original with a `.pre-uninstall.bak` suffix.

Two things are opt-in, because they're commonly wanted independently of
DeckShift:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--remove-packages` | also remove the AUR `gamescope-session*` packages |
| `--revert-grub` | also strip `nvidia-drm.modeset=1` and regenerate GRUB |

Add `--yes` to skip the prompts. Your group memberships (`video`, `input`,
`wheel`) are never touched — removing yourself from `wheel` would cost you sudo,
and you may well have been in them before installing.

## Changelog

- **v0.2.2-z13.2** — Z13 fork: `setup_fcitx_silence` no longer appends `env = FCITX_NO_WAYLAND_DIAGNOSE,1` to the dead pre-Quattro `hyprland.conf` (Omarchy 4's Lua provider ignores it); the env is set only via `~/.config/environment.d`.
- **v0.2.2-z13.1** — Z13 fork: migration-safe session cleanup. The old-file cleanup skips package-owned `/usr/bin/steamos-*` / `jupiter-biosupdate` (`pacman -Qo`), the client package is reinstalled in place instead of removed first, and the install forces `--aur` so `gamescope-session-steam-git` cannot resolve to the conflicting `cachyos/gamescope-session-cachyos`. `--verify` is sudo-aware (no false missing-file list without cached credentials) and checks `sessions.d/steam` so a missing Steam session client is caught. Install and uninstall also remove the retired stack's hook, post-update script, `.pre-hotfix` backup, and stale keybind file.
- **v0.2.2** — Screen sharing after a Gaming Mode round-trip actually fixed: `switch-to-desktop` writes the recovery marker before the teardown that used to kill it, and `deckshift-portal-recovery` restarts the portal frontend Steam poisons inside gamescope (no more pipewire bounce, and it self-triggers on the broken state). Exiting Gaming Mode no longer clobbers the CPU governor/power profile with a guess. New `./uninstall.sh` with `--dry-run`. Opt-in Gaming Mode session logs from the control panel (dated files under `~/.local/state/omarchy/nosignal.deckshift/`, 10 newest kept). NVIDIA DRM modeset is detected via Omarchy's modprobe/sysfs (not only `/proc/cmdline`) and enabled with the same `nvidia.conf` drop-ins + initramfs rebuild, any bootloader. `--verify` reads `/etc/group` for `video`/`input`/`wheel` so group checks pass without logging out.
- **v0.2.1** — Fix fresh installs failing with "target not found": dropped `lib32-openal`, `lib32-sdl2-compat` and `lib32-libvdpau` (removed from Arch multilib); installer now skips repo-dropped packages instead of aborting.
- **v0.2.0** — Native Omarchy 4 control panel (bar icon + panel, `Super+Alt+G`) replaces the gum settings TUI; saved settings now actually reach the running session (`set-environment` fix); Launch Gaming Mode from the panel behind a confirm.
- **v0.1.15** — Omarchy 4 compatibility: keybind and portal-recovery autostart moved to the Lua config files (`bindings.lua` / `autostart.lua`, `.conf` fallback for pre-4); Walker/elephant integration removed. *(v0.1.14 was an unreleased keybind change that was reverted; the number is skipped.)*
- **v0.1.13** — Pacman hook re-applies gamescope's `cap_sys_nice` after every upgrade (pacman silently strips file capabilities when it replaces the binary).
- **v0.1.12** — Refresh-rate selection actually reaches gamescope: the AUR session script assumes a fork-only `--custom-refresh-rates` flag, so the installer now patches in a `--nested-refresh` fallback (re-applied on every run).
- **v0.1.11** — Multi-monitor: hide an auxiliary monitor before Gaming Mode (`OUTPUT_CONNECTOR_TO_DISABLE`, runtime-only, monitor returns automatically on desktop).
- **v0.1.10** — Settings TUI layout polish (single aligned panel column, adaptive width).
- **v0.1.9** — Auto-migrate legacy scalar refresh-rate values on installer re-run.
- **v0.1.8** — Settings apply without re-login; refresh rate written as a comma list with a 60 Hz floor.
- **v0.1.7** — Steam bootstrap delegated to `omarchy-install-gaming-steam` (fixes AMD installs); dependency cleanup.
- **v0.1.6** — Omarchy-only: dropped the non-Omarchy portal-recovery fallback.
- **v0.1.5** — Clipboard recovery after returning from Gaming Mode.
- **v0.1.4** — Portal recovery race fix — screen sharing works reliably after returning to desktop.
- **v0.1.3** — Power-state save/restore (CPU governor + power profile) and reliable session exit.
- **v0.1.2** — TUI hardening + hybrid PRIME offload (`[hybrid-nvidia]` / `[hybrid-amd]`).
- **v0.1.1 / v0.1.0** — Original fork: settings TUI, NVIDIA driver branch auto-pick, idempotent installs, optional Xbox controller support, Intel GPU support.
